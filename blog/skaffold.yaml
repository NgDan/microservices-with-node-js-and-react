        # this is sort of a "hot reload". If we change any file that is matched by
        # the matcher, skaffold is going to replace that file directly into the running
        # pod, without rebuilding the image. If the file doesn't match the matcher
        # (for example if we change something in package.json) then skaffold
        # will rebuild everything
        # This, combined with nodemon, which watchs over the files
        # that skaffold loads into the running pod,
        # gives a nice development environment where there are
        # 2 stages for achieving a restart.
        # stage 1 is skaffold watching the file and loading them
        # into the running container when you save them and
        # stage 2 when nodemon detects that new file and restarts
        # the process
